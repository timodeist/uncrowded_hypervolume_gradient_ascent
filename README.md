# Uncrowded Hypervolume (UHV) gradient ascent
This is a Python implementation of the Adam-based Uncrowded Hypervolume Gradient Ascent algorithm (UHV-Adam) described in:

The final authenticated version of the manuscript will be available in the conference proceedings of Parallel Problem Solving from Nature â€“ PPSN XVI.

To run the algorithm on the four quadratic benchmarks described in the manuscript (Table 2):

1) Clone the repository

2) Create a subfolder named 'statistics' within the base folder

3) Run `python3 script_run_experiment.py` 

Statistics of each optimization run can then be found in the subfolder 'statistics'.
